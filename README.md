# convert_dayone_json_2_markdown_files
This is simple Python script to convert [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/) exported JSON file with photos in separate markdown files and photo files in subfolders.

I had the real need to move away from DayOne to markdown files, because I prefer now the flexilitiy of plain text files. I used the oportunity to learn a bit Python and to work with GitHub. After I spent one day programming I found this script which looks much more Python style: [day2md](https://github.com/tuxedocat/dayone2md)

Please feel free critize my programming style and point me to improvements.

## Installation
- download the script and load it into your preferred Python IDE.
- adapt the initial variables
- run the script
